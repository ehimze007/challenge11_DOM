# Shopping Cart JavaScript Code

This JavaScript code provides functionality for a simple shopping cart. It allows users to update the quantity of items, add items to the cart, remove items from the cart, and toggle the "liked" status of items.

## Usage

1. Include the JavaScript code in your HTML file.
2. Make sure the necessary HTML elements are present in your document, such as buttons for incrementing and decrementing quantity, adding items to the cart, removing items from the cart, and displaying the total price.
3. Add appropriate classes and attributes to the HTML elements to match the selectors used in the JavaScript code.
4. Ensure that the necessary CSS styles are defined to achieve the desired appearance.

## Functions

1. `updateQuantity(element, increment)`: Updates the quantity of an item based on the specified increment. It finds the closest product item element, retrieves the quantity element and current quantity, and modifies the quantity accordingly. It then calls `updateTotalPrice()` to update the total price.

2. `updateTotalPrice()`: Calculates the total price of all items in the cart. It iterates over each product item element, retrieves the quantity and price, and accumulates the total. The calculated total price is displayed in the designated element.

3. `toggleLike(element)`: Toggles the "liked" class on the specified element. This is used to change the appearance of the like button when clicked.

4. `removeItem(element)`: Removes the corresponding product item from the cart. It finds the closest product item element and removes it from the DOM. After removal, it calls `updateTotalPrice()` to update the total price.

5. `addToCart(element)`: Adds the corresponding item to the cart. It retrieves the name, price, and quantity of the product item and performs any necessary actions or updates.

## Event Listeners

The code sets up event listeners for the following actions:

- Increment buttons: Calls `updateQuantity()` with the appropriate parameters when clicked.
- Decrement buttons: Calls `updateQuantity()` with the appropriate parameters when clicked.
- Like buttons: Calls `toggleLike()` when clicked.
- Remove buttons: Calls `removeItem()` when clicked.
- Add-to-cart buttons: Calls `addToCart()` when clicked.

## Customization

To use this code with your specific HTML structure and styling:

- Modify the selector strings used to select elements based on your HTML classes or attributes.
- Adapt the event listener setup if your HTML structure differs.
- Customize the functions' actions and behavior to match your requirements.
- Apply necessary CSS styles to ensure proper visual presentation.
